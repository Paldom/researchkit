## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Core research engine ported from the pre-OSS codebase: 8 concurrent
  AI web-search providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, Tavily, Claude,
  GitHub, GLM) with graceful degradation, cross-provider synthesis,
  LLM council + boost orchestration, Exa site research, project persistence,
  and per-run observability.
- `researchkit` CLI (instant mode, create/run/list, user sources, link
  analytics, keyword tooling).
- `researchkit-mcp`: stdio MCP server exposing `research`,
  `list_research_projects`, and `get_research_report` tools.
- `researchkit-server`: FastAPI backend with SSE progress streaming, project
  and report endpoints, and static serving of the built web UI.
- React 19 + Vite + Tailwind 4 web dashboard (`web/`): research form, live
  provider progress, rendered cited reports, past-project browser.
- `models.yaml` presets (safe defaults; deep-research/CLI-backed modes
  opt-in), `.env.example`, and a frontend CI job.
- Full project toolchain: uv packaging, ruff, mypy (strict), pytest coverage
  gate, pre-commit, CI, and tag-triggered PyPI publishing.

### Changed

- mypy runs strict globally with a shrink-only exemption list for ported
  modules; the coverage gate is set at the measured 35% baseline with a
  ratchet-up policy (see `pyproject.toml` comments).
